title: Two Ways Games Model Real-World Learning

You’ve graduated college with straight-A’s and now you are in the real world. You land your first job and just as you’re settling into your cubicle, your boss asks you if you know how to do X.

Of course! you say, remembering a class on Advanced Implementation of X, Y, and Z.

But then you see her assignment and you freeze. What’s the right answer? Is there even a right answer?

With all the moving parts, grey areas, the fact that your company has a policy in place, the other people, the real stakes...

You feel stuck. It looks like you’re going to either
1. Admit you don’t know what to do
2. Make some mistakes and figure it out
3. Some combination of both

None of those feel good, since you’ve always been told not to do those things in school.

### A for Effort, but still an F
Most successful students never learn how to use mistakes for learning.

This is because we spend our education avoiding mistakes at all costs. Improvement gets lip service, but there are no points for failing repeatedly on the path to mastery.

So where do you learn to struggle?

Where do you learn how to face a totally opaque problem and slowly start chipping away at it, to experiment, to play with a problem until it starts to take shape in your mind?

**Games! Of course.**

(Or code, but that’s another issue).

There are two ways that games mimic real-world learning and give us the tools to grow.

## 1. There is More Than 1 Right Answer in Games
One of the most interesting things about playing a video game is finding out many different ways you can win.

For example, take a simple game like Pac-Man. You move around and you chomp pixels and avoid ghosts. Within those simple limitations, play is open-ended.
* You can follow whatever path you like.
* You can adopt an aggressive, risk-taking play style.
* You can plan things out or play by the seat of your pants.

You see this in more complex games like Super Smash Bros. and Starcraft as well, where different players exhibit different play styles, even while controlling the same characters.

One player might play Zerg as a creeping behemoth while another plays an aggressive, reckless mob.

Or, the same player might adopt different styles depending on the situation.

**Thus, when playing games, you learn that there are plenty of options. Some work better than others, but none are wrong.**

1. One strategy might pay off in the short-term but leave you struggling later on. Better make sure you win quickly.
2. A second strategy might make you vulnerable early on but unstoppable in the late game. Just gotta stay alive!
3. A third strategy might require you to wait on your opponent and adjust based on what they are doing. Invest in intel.
4. Yet another approach takes advantage of a common vulnerability but requires you to adopt a play style that is complicated or tricky. Time to brush up on your skillz.

**You aren't told the right way, and so you don't get it in your head that there is a “right” way**...just some good ways, some bad ways, maybe a definitely best-for-now way, but they are all options.

### 2. Games Teach The Missing Skill
In games like Starcraft and Smash, you see some players who are clearly very skilled, but they lack that special something.

They can’t seem to adapt. They have mastered a play style and stick with it.

Then you get players who seem to read your mind. You feel like you are handing them your own defeat because they read you so well. You go left and they are right there waiting for you.

**The ability to read the circumstances in order to know when to apply best principles is itself a skill**.

You can’t learn this from a book or even from someone who has experience to share.

You can learn what signs to look for, but until you know what it feels like, both to experience and to act in response, you can never claim mastery.

**The only way to learn to read a situation is through experience of many situations.**

This is costly; Tim Ferriss recommends that those aspiring to become angel investors commit to losing $50K in order to learn by doing, rather than going to business school. Consider it the cost of tuition.

By writing off that money from the beginning, would-be angels allow themselves to fail a lot, which accelerates their rate of learning simply by giving them more situations to try reading.

Ferriss’s advice to would-be investors is actually very game-like:
* Give yourself “extra lives”. Expect to burn through them.
* If an opportunity doesn’t work, bail and start over (reset the level).
* Have concrete goals (points) and a set timeframe (level timer).

**It’s all very contrived, but in a way that encourages a playful, experimental approach.**

While this is an extreme case, experiential learning always has higher costs than traditional. Time, energy, money, reputation, ego, whatever.

**It is always easier and safer to study, but you forgo the skill of knowing when to apply which principles.**

We like games because they condense learning into very rapid iterations: you can face dozens of situations in a game session and thus experiment with dozens of ways to apply the principles you’ve acquired through experience or study.

Thus, games model real-world learning because they reward extensive and creative experimentation and teach you how to read  and adapt to a variety of situations.
