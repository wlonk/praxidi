title: Why People Fight Over Games
---
It was a dark and stormy night. We were playing Monopoly. This was my first time with the group, which had a house rule that you could buy rent immunity. Basically, in exchange for a property, the buyer would not charge you rent on that or some other properties of theirs you landed on.

To me, this was stupid. It broke a core rule of the game (if you land on a property you do not own, you must pay the rent to the owner), and it defeated what I saw as the purpose of the game: to win at everyone else’s expense.

I decided to ignore the spirit of the house rule (everyone gets to have fun) and abused it. I traded ALL of my properties for rent immunity from everyone else and skidded around the board until everyone realized what I was doing and it stopped being fun for them.

Looking back (way back, this was in high school), I realize now that we were playing for different reasons:

* My friends had taken a notoriously anti-social game and made it into something fun and casual, which was what they wanted.
* I wasn’t having fun unless there were stakes. My solution was to make the game not fun for them by leveraging the new rule as I would any other rule of the game: to win.

Needless to say, I was not invited back.

We all come to games with different expectations. Some of us just want a way to pass the time. Some of us crave the learning experience and the challenge. Some of us like to get lost in the world. But you can bet that where there are points to be scored and games to be won, feelings will get hurt.

The last time I played Monopoly with my fiancé, we had a fight that hasn’t been matched since, complete will yelling, tears, and threats to leave.

Why do people take games so personally?

### Not all games are Games
There is a lot of argument about the definition of a game. I’m not going to argue with common usage; I’ll admit that *Candy Crush* is as much a “game” as *Settlers of Catan*, but I do want to make some distinctions that are important in understanding why people get into fights over games.

Games that do little more than distract, fill time, or provide a pretext for people at a party to interact in some way are often better described as diversions. Many addictive smartphone games fall into this category and most party games are actually just forms of diversion. There are goals and rules and obstructions to the goal, but no real strategy or skill needed.

Card games like War which allow for no strategy or decision-making whatsoever would also fall into this category. It’s literally just something to do with a deck of cards. You might as well flip quarters competitively.

On the other side of the spectrum you have war games and simulations, which can be extremely not-fun to play. A flight simulator is not entertaining to most people, but it gives you the chance to test your decisions and try new things without danger. The essential point is that there is a goal, there is strategy, and there is a problem obstructing the goal. Critically, these games are not real; you can mess up without dying, unlike the events they simulate.

In general, even hard games that are well-designed are fun. Humans usually respond to well-structured incentive systems with clearly defined goals, rules, and challenges that are just hard enough, and we all have our line for [where hard bleeds into hellish](http://www.denofgeek.com/us/games/video-games/249481/top-25-brutally-difficult-video-games).

### Not Everyone Sees Games the Same Way
Just as games have different intentions, people approach them with different goals. That’s not surprising. But if you’re playing Monopoly to pass a rainy day with your partner and they are playing to win at all costs (within the rules of the game)...there will be problems

And the worst part is everyone seems to assume a)everyone plays games for the same reason they do, or b) others are sleazy and shallow (if they play to win) or spoilsports (if they play for fun and get upset).

I don’t think there’s anything wrong with trying to win as long as mutually agreed upon rules aren’t broken. And I don’t think there’s anything wrong with playing for fun.

The tension arises when those expectations mix in the same game and the players are not aware of it.

### Mean games make mean people
If your priority is to win the game, that can lead you to start acting in ways that can be disturbing to other players, especially those who don’t share your goals.

Depending on how much you allow a game’s incentives to influence your own value system, you may be more willing to play hard. For example, you might lie and backstab allies in Risk, at the expense of your relationships outside the game.

If you get too caught up in a game, it can change what you consider decent behavior. In the Stanford Prison Experiment, for example, participants randomly assigned the role of guard become more domineering and aggressive.

Games create incentives for certain actions, and our desire to win makes us more willing to engage in those actions, even if they are out of the realm of socially acceptable.

### Smart players maintain their perspective
That said, ultimately, we should always keep in mind WHY we are playing a game. If it is to have fun, that should be the priority. Don’t cheat.

If it is to learn something, then do what you must. In a war game, the point is not to have fun. It is to try to win while following the rules, even to the point of tricking and taking advantage of your opponent.

In sports, there is a lot of disagreement about what, exactly, people are playing for. Professional athletes play for money, love of the game, to win, to entertain, and a variety of other reasons. That makes it hard to keep track of things like doping, cheating, and fair play. For some players, part of the game is finding ways to break the rules without getting caught. Cheating is justified by the stakes.

For athletes with more perspective, sportsmanship is crucial, partly because the purpose of professional sports might be to provide society with a model of healthy competitiveness. They recognize that the game has a larger purpose in society.

In Jane Austen’s novels, characters who are meant to be strategically mature don’t let winning games get in the way of winning their larger goals. Eliza and Darcy, for example, are not good or very engaged in the card games their fellow partygoers play, while more clueless characters often brag about their skill at cards.

### How to Cause a Break-up
Of course, games, and gamers, can fall somewhere in the middle: fun games that *also* give people the chance to try on new ideas and actions.

The problems arise when you have two people with different expectations about what a game is, playing a game that is ambiguous.

People seeking just distraction don’t play war-games, and gamers seeking experimentation don’t play Candy Crush. But both will sometimes play Monopoly and Risk. That’s when sparks fly.
