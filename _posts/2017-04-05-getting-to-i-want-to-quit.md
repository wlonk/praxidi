# Getting to "I Want to Quit"
If you want to be successful at something, get to the point of wanting to quit as fast as you can. That's the best way to find out what your dream will really take and if you are willing to push through the worst. It is also the point where you learn your limits and what you need learn in order to succeed.

You will also discover what you will need to put up with in whatever you're trying to do. As my wife reminded me when I was banging my head on the table attempting to finish my math assignments, “If you want to be a mathematician, this is what your day-to-day will be like.”

It's hard, but getting yourself to that point of “I want to quit” teaches you a lot about yourself and give you the information you need to move forward.

We’re biased, but we think that games are great for this because they help mitigate a lot of the discomfort and social pressure, while still making you painfully aware of how much you ~~suck~~ can grow and what exactly you need to do to grow.

## The Hero’s Journey
Normally, the low-point in the hero’s journey is connected with a trip to the underworld. In a way, that is the ultimate opportunity to quit: just stay there and you die. Life is done. You don’t have to try anymore.

But the hero’s journey is about coming back, and even when it isn’t a literal, or even metaphorical, trip to the underworld, we still see that low-point play out in our stories as the Quitting Point.

In movies and TV shows about success stories, that dramatic moment may be overplayed for the sake of the story, but it also reminds us that committing to something when the world is telling us to step down is the best way to develop a passion. (Cal Newport's book *So Good They Can't Ignore You* makes this point very well: passion is not the cause of hard work, it is the reward for hard work).

Once the protagonist/future-billionaire/aspiring superhero get to that quitting point in the movie, we know it's about to get real. We, as the audience, know that the hero needs to hit rock bottom and decide to keep going before things turn around.

Cue: every superhero movie ever.

In the real-world, things don't always "work out" after that point, but in our psychology, that's where the shift occurs. Once you've seriously contemplated quitting, and decided not to despite all the signs, your mindset shifts. Now you're ready to play.

More than that, now you are aware of what it takes to play.

Ironically, that desire to quit is a sign that you're doing things right.

## The Insurmountable Obstacle
You have to get to the point of feeling so out of your element, so behind, so painfully inadequate, that the best course of action seems like throwing in the towel to save everyone the pain of watching you fail.

This is because the "Quitting Point" is the point where your efforts and skills have proven inadequate. Everything up to that was just warmup and probably well within your current capabilities.

Everything after is new and requires you to be someone else.
You are presented with two choices:

1. Remain as you are and walk away
2. Become someone new and keep going until the next Quitting Point

Once you get to that point, you will know exactly what you need to do to succeed, even if the insight is simply "try something different."

## A Very Bad Pilot
My personal struggle with this, and the moment that really taught me how it all works, was pilot training. In high school, I had the great fortune to take flight lessons. I was finally pursuing my dream of becoming a pilot, something I had dreamed of since I was four-years-old.

But it was only about a month in before I wanted very badly to quit.

I sucked, and I didn’t like being bad at something. My instructor was openly impatient with me, and at one point even cut my visual navigation lesson short because I was so bad. I nearly took out the propeller on my solo cross country because I forgot to pack sunglasses. I failed my oral exam.

I figured I just wasn't cut out to be a pilot, but I had a lot of pressure to stay in from my parents (which I appreciate).

Wanting to quit, and deciding not to, was for me the turning point in learning to fly. If I wanted to be a pilot, I would have to learn to be comfortable with costly mistakes and personal inadequacy on the road to mastery.

## Learning Persistence Through Games
One thing that helped me push forward in flying were all the flight games I played as a kid. I remember owning the Top Gun simulator and crashing dozens of times into the backside of a carrier as I tried to learn to execute landings. Nobody was watching then, as they were when I was flying, but the game showed me that it is possible to go from bad to good.

Games are really good at teaching that. They don't punish you for walking away, but they allow you to come to terms with that desire to throw in the towel. You can explore how you handle seemingly impossible difficulty and eventually learn what it feels like to be certain "I can't" until you reach "I can."

Video games, in particular, have been criticized for a lot of things, but they have been [consistently lauded as teaching persistence](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0360131512001625) in the face of difficult problems.

That's one reason the games Praxidi makes are actually pretty hard to win; we want you to get to the point of feeling like "this is stupid."

1. It makes it that much sweeter when you do win
2. It teaches you what it feels like to come face-to-face with your own inadequacy, move forward anyway, and overcome your limitations.

When this happens cooperatively, as it does in most of Praxidi's games, that's an even sweeter victory for the team.
