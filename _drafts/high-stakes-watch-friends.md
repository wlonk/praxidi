title: When the Stakes are High, Watch Your Friends
---
Thesis: Stress reveals character, so the best way to know someone is to observe them under stress

Opening story: Camping

Problem: it’s hard to simulate stress when it’s not real.
				 real stress entails real stakes, thus real risk
				 Doing this in a business is hard or impossible
				 People try really hard to disguise their attitudes and remain acceptable when they know they are being watched.
				 
Solution: Create a sense of urgency and stress combined with a casual environment that invites open and authentic participation.

Topic 1: What to Look For in Individuals
Topic 2: Group Dynamics

It can be really hard to identify problems in group dynamics under day-to-day circumstances. There is ample time and presence of mind to adjust behavior and deal with clunky systems. But that doesn’t mean inefficiencies shouldn’t be addressed.

There’s an interesting story about the Cold War in which former US Secretary of Defense Robert McNamara was approached by an aide in the Pentagon. There was a call for the President from the USSR on the “hotline.”

McNamara’s response was, “Why the hell did you call me?”

It turned out that the hotline stopped in the Pentagon, which McNamara, who’d been there 7 years, didn’t even know. It wasn’t a regular telephone and nobody had ever used it outside of exercises, so they had no idea how the system would work in a real emergency.

The event revealed a communication fault, not something that broke the system, but a hiccup that could have cost a lot.

Often, that sort of thing goes unnoticed day-to-day because we develop systems to accommodate an inefficiency.

However, when an emergency happens, the slight lag can cause big problems. A highly placed USSR official was on the other line, and the President had to be woken up and took twenty minutes to get on the phone. That’s a lifetime during the Cold War.

Hopefully your team doesn’t deal with nuclear emergencies (if you do, I would love to talk) but it could probably stand to learn something about how it works under stress.

Maybe one of you team doesn’t respond in a timely fashion to “important” emails. Everyone else has worked around this by simply making decisions without him.

As a result, he gets shorted on project ownership, and ends up making his own adaptations.

Then something critical breaks and he doesn’t have full buy-in, which leads from a technical problem to an interpersonal one. Suddenly, a well-oiled team is dealing with both a broken system and internal conflict.

All because there weren’t expectations set about email norms.

### Some things to look for:
1. Does a leader emerge, and does the rest of the group defer, challenge, or support that leader?
2. How much dissent is there in general? Less is not always better.
3. Are certain members shut down or are their ideas dismissed or minimized?
4. Are communication tools accessible to all or is someone in control of the information? The latter case isn’t always bad if it works.
5. Does the group develop certain rituals or do they try to be flexible and adaptive? There’s a balance, which is different from team to team, but generally, internal rituals allow external flexibility.
