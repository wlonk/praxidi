title: How Games Model Real-World Learning (vs Academic)

You’ve just spent the last 4 years studying for your degree and now you are in the real world. You land your first job and just as you’re settling into your cubicle, your boss asks you if you know how to do X. “Well sure,” you say, remembering how you covered that in one of your classes on Advanced Implementation of X, Y and Z. “Great! Take a look at this.” She drops a stack of documents on your desk and walks off. You peer at the first page and, while the topic of the report makes sense, you have zero context and no idea what specific actions you can take to do X.

Now you’re feeling a little nervous. In your X, Y and Z courses, there was definitely a “right” answer. Here, with all the moving parts, grey areas, the fact that your company has a policy in place, the other people, you’re not sure what the right answer is, or even if there is a right answer.

You feel stuck. You thought you knew this, but it turns out there was something missing.

### Learning By Doing
Often, in traditional learning environments, the emphasis is on understanding the principles. From those, you can discern a proper way to do a thing, or a proper way to understand a thing.

I have seen this a lot in math students who confuse the solution to a problem with the method of finding that solution. When I show them several different ways to do a problem, they are often surprised to discover that they had any options at all. From what they had been taught, the correct solution also involved a particular set of steps.

How does this relate to games?

### Gamers Test The Rules
One of the most interesting things about playing a video game is finding out how far you can push the rules of the game. Even within the rules of the game, there are usually many, many solutions to a particular problem (if the game was well-designed).

For example, take a simple game like Pac-Man. You move around and you chomp pixels and avoid ghosts. Within those simple limitations, play is open-ended. You can follow whatever path you like. You can adopt an aggressive, risk-taking play style. You can plan things out or play by the seat of your pants.

You see this in games like Super Smash Bros. and Starcraft as well, where different players exhibit different play styles, even while controlling the same characters. They follow some principles of play, but one character’s Zerg might be relatively cautious compared to another’s.

Thus, when playing these games, you learn that there are plenty of options. Some work better than others, but that's where the learning comes in. You aren't told the right way, and so you don't get it in your head that there *is* a “right” way...just some good ways, some bad ways, maybe a definitely best-for-now way, but they are all options.

### The Missing Skill
In games like Starcraft and Smash, principles of good play have arisen, but they came out by observing and studying what has worked best in experimentation.

Of course, that’s how all principles arose, but when you are taught principles first, you can forget that they were learned by experimentation and play, and **that the ability to read the circumstances in order to know when to apply best principles is itself a skill**.

This is rarely something you can learn from a book or even from someone who has experience to share. Because circumstances are so varied and complex, full of subtle cues and imperceptible hints, learning to read them is best done through experience.

This is costly, which is probably why it is rarely done. Tim Ferriss recommends that those aspiring to become angel investors commit to losing $50K in order to learn by doing. That’s the cost of tuition, he says. That’s a lot of money!

By being willing to lose all that money, would-be angels also allow themselves to fail a lot, which accelerates their rate of learning simply by giving them more situations to try reading.

Investing is an area where reading the situation is basically the entire job. While this is an extreme case, experience always has costs. Time, energy, money, reputation, ego, whatever. It is always easier and safer to study, but you forgo the skill of knowing when to apply which principles.

We like games because they condense learning in very rapid iterations: you can face dozens of situations in a game session and thus experiment with dozens of ways to apply the principles you’ve acquired through experience or study. 

### Order Matters
Newcomers to competitive games often get caught up in trying to learn established principles without really understanding the game or how they play. They try to fast forward.

In his book, *The Talent Code* XXX shares research suggesting that the best teachers for young students aren’t those who teach great principles, but rather those who encourage the student and support their exploration of what works and what doesn’t. The goal is to engage a student’s curiosity before trying to sharpen their skills.

### When Subjects Mature
Some subjects are unapproachable without some knowledge, but I think the degree of unapproachability is overblown. With just a little bit of structure, people can learn languages really well even without understanding too much of the grammar, mainly through experimentation and exploration. This is the technique of the Mormon Language School, one of the most successful language training programs in the world.

Similarly, with a bit of scaffolding, math can be taught in an exploratory manner. So can anything else.

The goal of educational support therefore, shouldn’t be about directing learning, but accelerating it.

The requirements for doing that are the following:
1. Eliminating/minimizing risks associated with experimentation
2. Providing contextual problems and the chance to struggle with them
3. Providing easy access to support to leapfrog sticking points

Games, of course, do all these things, to varying degrees depending on how well-designed they are.

1. Largely by definition, games eliminate the risk of failure. Thus, they encourage experimentation.
2. The problems in games are context-sensitive and, while they may be simplified at early stages or in tutorials, quickly incorporate more and more variables.
3. Games don’t always have built-in mechanisms for helping players quickly acquire skills or knowledge to get past sticking points. Often, those can be found in gaming communities in which knowledge is share with a respect for the value of the struggle (spoiler alerts, etc.). You can choose how much help you get.

Thus, games model real-world learning because they reward extensive and creative experimentation and attention to the principles that reveal themselves.
